## Deployment
### `How to open this project`
1. Copy this link "https://bookreviews-heroku.herokuapp.com/"
1. Paste and open on a browser

### Connecting the Application to MongoDB
1. Logged into my MongoDB account.
1. With the "Clusters" tab selected, I clicked on "Connect"
1. Selected "Connect your application"
1. Selected "Python" as the "Driver" and "Version" "3.6 or later".
1. Copied the connection string and pasted it in my env.py file editing it to include my dbname and my user password.
1. Created an instance of PyMongo and passed the application to that instance as below:
-       mongo = PyMongo(app)

### Local Deployment
* On the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LongVN99/Milestone_Project_3), click on the 'â†“ Code' button.
* Copy the link to clone the repository using the HTTPS tab.
* In your preferred IDE CLI, navigate to the directory you would like to clone to.
* Type `git clone ` followed by the URL you copied from step 3 and press enter.
* Once cloned, all files from workspace will be visible.
* You will need to create an `env.py` that had previously been added to the `.gitignore` file.
* To test type `python3 app.py runserver` into the CLI and open the 8080 port.
* Finally using git you can push this to your own GitHub repository.

### Heroku Deployment
*In Gitpod:*

* Once the Flask App is created, the following OS default environment variables were set in the `env.py` file:
    * "IP", with the IP address you want the app to run on.
    * "PORT", with the specified port.
    * "SECRET_KEY", with a value generated from a random key generator.
    * "MONGO_URI", with the connection string from MongoDB.
    * "MONGO_DBNAME", with the database name

* This file along with all other sensitive files were added to the `.gitignore` file.
* To specify the Python package dependencies to Heroku the requirements.txt file was created using the command `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
* The Procfile was also created using the command `echo web: python app.py` to tell Heroku that the `app.py` file uses the Python language.

*In Heroku:*

* A new app was created with the name 'bookreviews-heroku'.
* In the 'Deploy Tab' GitHub was connected using the repository name.
* In the 'Settings' tab of Heroku, the Configuration Variables (Config Vars) were added (these are the 'key: value' pairs that were declared in the `env.py` file).
* Back in the 'Deploy' tab the 'Enable Automatic Deployment' button was clicked to allow automatic updates from GitHub.
* The branch was then deployed from the master.

*In Gitpod:*

* The Mongo database is then wired up to the Flask app by adding the Mongo links to the default environment variables.

### Adding A requirements.txt File

To add the list of Python dependencies that the project needs in order to run successfully and detect the language:

* `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` - command in the terminal to create a requirements.txt file, 

### Adding A Procfile

To inform Heroku on how to run the application and which file runs it the **Procfile** was installed:

* `echo web: python app.py > Procfile` - with a capital 'P' command in the terminal to redirect the echo command.
